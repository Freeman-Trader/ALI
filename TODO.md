1. Need to create an algorithem that will create duplicate input neurons since each neuron can only fire once for a single input 
    
2. Look into line 151 of Brain.hpp

3. Tidy up code

4. Look into modifing neuron class such that it has a negative breakcount rather than only being able to activate once

5. Might want to change the the intialization of the input array to one thats static rather than dynamically. This would mean making it so the it has
    the neurons permade rather than creating them as the program goes
